# Testing Progress Report

## Summary
This report documents the progress made in increasing code coverage for the FreeAgentics project.

## Completed Tasks

### 1. Python Testing Infrastructure
- ✅ Set up pytest with coverage tools
- ✅ Created comprehensive test fixtures for active inference components
- ✅ Established testing patterns and conventions

### 2. Active Inference Engine Tests
- ✅ Created `tests/unit/test_active_inference.py` with 36 test functions
- ✅ Created `tests/fixtures/active_inference_fixtures.py` with reusable test fixtures
- Coverage areas:
  - InferenceConfig validation and defaults
  - VariationalMessagePassing algorithm
  - BeliefPropagation algorithm  
  - GradientDescentInference
  - NaturalGradientInference
  - ExpectationMaximization
  - ParticleFilterInference
  - Hierarchical inference
  - Performance optimizations
  - End-to-end integration

### 3. Generative Model Tests
- ✅ Created `tests/unit/test_generative_model.py` with 29 test functions
- Coverage areas:
  - ModelDimensions dataclass
  - ModelParameters dataclass
  - DiscreteGenerativeModel
  - ContinuousGenerativeModel
  - HierarchicalGenerativeModel
  - FactorizedGenerativeModel
  - Model factory function
  - Integration tests

### 4. Agent Base Class Tests
- ✅ Created `tests/unit/test_base_agent.py` with 30 test functions
- Coverage areas:
  - AgentData dataclass
  - Position dataclass with distance calculations
  - BaseAgent lifecycle management
  - Agent subsystem integration
  - Performance characteristics
  - Multi-agent coordination

## Current Status

### Test Count
- **New tests created**: 95+ test functions
- **Existing tests found**: 968 test functions across 60 test files
- **Total tests**: 1063+ test functions

### Coverage Estimates
Based on partial test runs:
- **Active Inference modules**: Well-covered by new tests
- **Agent base modules**: ~30-35% coverage (existing tests)
- **Overall Python coverage**: Estimated 35-40% currently

### Issues Encountered
1. **PyTorch Import Conflict**: Some test files experience PyTorch double import issues
   - This affects coverage reporting but not individual test execution
   - Tests pass when run individually or in small groups

2. **API Mismatches**: Some generative model tests need adjustment for actual API
   - Factory function uses keyword arguments, not positional
   - Some model classes have different initialization patterns

## Next Steps

### Immediate Actions
1. Fix PyTorch import issues to enable full coverage reporting
2. Update generative model tests to match actual API
3. Run comprehensive coverage report once import issues are resolved

### Phase 1 Completion (Target: 50% Python Coverage)
1. Write tests for remaining core modules:
   - agents/base/behaviors.py
   - inference/engine/policy_selection.py
   - coalitions/formation/coalition_builder.py

2. Enhance existing test coverage:
   - Add edge case tests
   - Add integration tests
   - Add performance benchmarks

### Phase 2: Frontend Testing (Target: 80% Coverage)
1. Set up Jest/React Testing Library
2. Write component tests
3. Write hook tests
4. Write integration tests

## Recommendations

1. **Fix Import Issues First**: The PyTorch import conflict is blocking accurate coverage measurement
2. **Leverage Existing Tests**: With 968 existing tests, focus on gaps rather than rewriting
3. **Incremental Approach**: Run tests in smaller batches to avoid import conflicts
4. **Documentation**: Update test documentation to help future contributors

## Metrics for Success
- [ ] Python coverage reaches 50% (Phase 1)
- [ ] All core modules have test files
- [ ] No failing tests in CI/CD
- [ ] Coverage report runs without errors
- [ ] Frontend testing infrastructure ready
