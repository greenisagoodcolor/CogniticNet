# Task ID: 14
# Title: Implement Readiness Assessment Integration
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 2, 12
# Priority: medium
# Description: Integrate technical, business, and safety readiness assessment.
# Details:
Build readiness integrator (coalitions/readiness/comprehensive_readiness_integrator.py). Calculate and aggregate readiness scores.

# Test Strategy:
Test readiness calculation, aggregation, and threshold detection.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Design Integrator Implementation Architecture [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Define the architectural blueprint for the readiness assessment integrator, ensuring modularity, scalability, and maintainability. Facilitate a committee debate: Robert C. Martin advocates for clean architecture and separation of concerns; Martin Fowler emphasizes evolutionary design and refactoring; Rich Hickey suggests simplicity and immutability; Conor Heins and Alexander Tschantz focus on computational modeling and system integration. Document architectural decisions and rationale.
### Details:
Produce system diagrams, interface definitions, and a rationale document capturing committee perspectives and consensus.

Before moving to the next subtask, ensure all tests pass: mypy, tsc, jest, pytest, flake8, ESLint.

## 2. Develop Mathematical Score Calculation Methods [pending]
### Dependencies: 14.1
### Description: Establish rigorous mathematical models for calculating readiness scores from multi-dimensional metrics. Committee debate: Yann LeCun and Geoffrey Hinton discuss neural and statistical approaches; Karl Friston and Thomas Parr advocate for Bayesian and free energy principles; Anil Seth and Jakob Hohwy focus on interpretability and cognitive plausibility. Ensure models are robust, explainable, and production-ready.
### Details:
Deliver mathematical formulations, scoring algorithms, and a summary of committee debates on model selection and justification.

Before moving to the next subtask, ensure all tests pass: mypy, tsc, jest, pytest, flake8, ESLint.

## 3. Implement Aggregation Logic for Multi-Dimensional Metrics [pending]
### Dependencies: 14.2
### Description: Design and implement logic to aggregate readiness scores across dimensions (e.g., technical, operational, human factors). Committee debate: Kent Beck and Martin Fowler discuss testability and refactoring; Demis Hassabis and Andy Clark focus on emergent properties and system-level integration; Rich Hickey emphasizes functional composition. Address edge cases and ensure aggregation logic is extensible.
### Details:
Provide aggregation algorithms, code samples, and a record of committee input on aggregation strategies and trade-offs.

Before moving to the next subtask, ensure all tests pass: mypy, tsc, jest, pytest, flake8, ESLint.

## 4. Define and Detect Readiness Thresholds [pending]
### Dependencies: 14.3
### Description: Establish threshold criteria for readiness based on aggregated scores, including dynamic and static thresholds. Committee debate: Karl Friston and Thomas Parr discuss adaptive thresholds using Bayesian inference; Yann LeCun and Geoffrey Hinton consider data-driven and machine learning-based thresholds; Anil Seth and Jakob Hohwy stress interpretability and user communication. Ensure thresholds are actionable and auditable.
### Details:
Produce threshold definitions, detection algorithms, and a summary of committee perspectives on threshold setting and validation.

Before moving to the next subtask, ensure all tests pass: mypy, tsc, jest, pytest, flake8, ESLint.

## 5. Comprehensive Testing and Validation [pending]
### Dependencies: 14.4
### Description: Pass integration and end-to-end tests before completing this task and moving to the next. Reference the PRD for acceptance criteria and committee review.
### Details:
All code must meet PRD requirements and be reviewed by the expert committee. Ensure all tests (mypy, tsc, jest, pytest, flake8, ESLint) pass and integration/end-to-end tests are green before closing the task.
