# Task ID: 9
# Title: Develop GNN Model Generation UI
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 3, 8
# Priority: medium
# Description: Build user interface for specifying GNN models via natural language.
# Details:
Create GMN specification UI in Next.js. Preview generated models. Connect to backend GNN generation service.

# Test Strategy:
Test UI input, model preview, and integration with backend.

# Subtasks:
## 1. UI Component Creation with Expert Committee Review [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Design and implement modular UI components for GNN specification and visualization, ensuring clarity, reusability, and accessibility. Facilitate a committee debate on component granularity, state management, and separation of concerns.
### Details:
Robert C. Martin advocates for single-responsibility and clean component boundaries. Kent Beck emphasizes testability and incremental delivery. Martin Fowler suggests patterns for UI composition and refactoring. Rich Hickey raises concerns about immutability and state handling in UI logic. The committee will debate the use of declarative vs. imperative UI frameworks, the trade-offs between component granularity and maintainability, and the architectural decision to use a node-link vs. matrix view for GNNs, referencing best practices in data visualization UI[1][3]. Production-ready considerations include accessibility, responsiveness, and extensibility.

Before moving to the next subtask, ensure all tests pass: mypy, tsc, jest, pytest, flake8, ESLint.

## 2. Input Validation with Mathematical Rigor and Cognitive Considerations [pending]
### Dependencies: 9.1
### Description: Develop robust input validation for GNN parameters and graph data, ensuring mathematical correctness and user guidance. Engage the committee to discuss validation strategies, error messaging, and cognitive load.
### Details:
Conor Heins, Alexander Tschantz, and Karl Friston stress the importance of mathematically rigorous input validation, especially for graph structures and GNN hyperparameters. Jakob Hohwy, Anil Seth, and Andy Clark discuss minimizing cognitive load and providing clear feedback to users. The committee debates schema-driven validation, real-time feedback, and the balance between strictness and user flexibility. Architectural decisions include whether to validate on the client, server, or both, and how to surface errors in a user-friendly yet precise manner.

Before moving to the next subtask, ensure all tests pass: mypy, tsc, jest, pytest, flake8, ESLint.

## 3. Model Preview Integration with Interactive Visualization and Theoretical Soundness [pending]
### Dependencies: 9.2
### Description: Integrate a real-time GNN model preview, linking mathematical operations to visual representations. The committee debates the fidelity of previews, animation of matrix operations, and educational value.
### Details:
Yann LeCun, Geoffrey Hinton, and Demis Hassabis advocate for accurate, interpretable previews that reflect underlying GNN computations. Thomas Parr and Karl Friston emphasize the importance of visualizing probabilistic and dynamic aspects of GNNs. The committee discusses the use of interactive node-link and matrix views[3], the integration of mathematical formulas with visual feedback, and the trade-offs between performance and detail. Production considerations include scalability for large graphs and browser-based rendering efficiency.

Before moving to the next subtask, ensure all tests pass: mypy, tsc, jest, pytest, flake8, ESLint.

## 4. Backend Connection with Secure, Scalable, and Maintainable Architecture [pending]
### Dependencies: 9.3
### Description: Establish a robust backend connection for model training, data persistence, and preview computation. The committee debates API design, security, and deployment strategies.
### Details:
Robert C. Martin and Martin Fowler focus on clean API contracts and separation of concerns. Rich Hickey raises issues of state synchronization and data consistency. Kent Beck emphasizes test-driven development and continuous integration. The committee debates REST vs. GraphQL, stateless vs. stateful backend design, and secure handling of user data. Production-ready considerations include horizontal scalability, fault tolerance, and monitoring.

Before moving to the next subtask, ensure all tests pass: mypy, tsc, jest, pytest, flake8, ESLint.

## 5. Integration and End-to-End Testing [pending]
### Dependencies: 9.4
### Description: Pass integration and end-to-end tests before completing this task and moving to the next. Reference the PRD for acceptance criteria and committee review.
### Details:
All code must meet PRD requirements and be reviewed by the expert committee. Ensure all tests (mypy, tsc, jest, pytest, flake8, ESLint) pass and integration/end-to-end tests are green before closing the task.
