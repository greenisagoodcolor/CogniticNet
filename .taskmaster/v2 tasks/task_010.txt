# Task ID: 10
# Title: Implement Knowledge Graph Management
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 2, 6
# Priority: medium
# Description: Build real-time knowledge graph construction and update logic.
# Details:
Implement knowledge graph manager (knowledge/knowledge_graph.py). Update graph from agent belief states. Calculate epistemic uncertainty metrics.

# Test Strategy:
Test graph updates, uncertainty calculations, and multi-agent synchronization.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Graph Manager Implementation [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Design and implement the core graph manager responsible for entity and relationship management, data ingestion, and integration across heterogeneous sources.
### Details:
Architectural decisions should prioritize modularity and extensibility (Robert C. Martin, Martin Fowler). Data ingestion pipelines must be robust and scalable (Rich Hickey). Use semantic models for entity and relationship definitions (Kent Beck). Incorporate production-ready error handling and validation (Conor Heins).

Before moving to the next subtask, ensure all tests pass: mypy, tsc, jest, pytest, flake8, ESLint.

## 2. Belief State Integration [pending]
### Dependencies: 10.1
### Description: Integrate belief states into the knowledge graph to represent agent confidence and uncertainty, enabling probabilistic reasoning and dynamic updates.
### Details:
Leverage probabilistic graphical models for belief state representation (Yann LeCun, Geoffrey Hinton). Ensure mathematical rigor in uncertainty propagation (Alexander Tschantz, Thomas Parr). Support dynamic belief updates based on new evidence (Andy Clark, Jakob Hohwy).

Before moving to the next subtask, ensure all tests pass: mypy, tsc, jest, pytest, flake8, ESLint.

## 3. Update Logic Implementation [pending]
### Dependencies: 10.1, 10.2
### Description: Develop update logic for the knowledge graph, supporting real-time modifications, conflict resolution, and consistency maintenance.
### Details:
Design update protocols for concurrent modifications (Rich Hickey, Kent Beck). Implement conflict resolution strategies (Robert C. Martin, Martin Fowler). Ensure consistency through transaction management and versioning (Demis Hassabis, Anil Seth).

Before moving to the next subtask, ensure all tests pass: mypy, tsc, jest, pytest, flake8, ESLint.

## 4. Uncertainty Metric Calculation [pending]
### Dependencies: 10.2, 10.3
### Description: Implement uncertainty metrics for graph entities and relationships, supporting decision-making and analytics.
### Details:
Define and compute uncertainty metrics using Bayesian or information-theoretic approaches (Alexander Tschantz, Karl Friston). Integrate metrics into query and reasoning pipelines (Yann LeCun, Geoffrey Hinton). Ensure production-ready performance and scalability (Demis Hassabis, Anil Seth).

Before moving to the next subtask, ensure all tests pass: mypy, tsc, jest, pytest, flake8, ESLint.

## 5. Multi-Agent Synchronization [pending]
### Dependencies: 10.3, 10.4
### Description: Enable multi-agent synchronization for distributed knowledge graph updates, ensuring consistency and minimizing conflicts.
### Details:
Design synchronization protocols for distributed agents (Rich Hickey, Kent Beck). Implement consensus mechanisms for conflict resolution (Robert C. Martin, Martin Fowler). Ensure mathematical rigor in synchronization logic (Alexander Tschantz, Karl Friston). Support production-ready deployment and monitoring (Demis Hassabis, Anil Seth).

Before moving to the next subtask, ensure all tests pass: mypy, tsc, jest, pytest, flake8, ESLint.

## 6. Integration and End-to-End Testing [pending]
### Dependencies: 10.5
### Description: Pass integration and end-to-end tests before completing this task and moving to the next. Reference the PRD for acceptance criteria and committee review.
### Details:
All code must meet PRD requirements and be reviewed by the expert committee. Ensure all tests (mypy, tsc, jest, pytest, flake8, ESLint) pass and integration/end-to-end tests are green before closing the task.
