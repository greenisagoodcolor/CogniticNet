# Task ID: 7
# Title: Design Real-Time Active Inference Visualization
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 3, 4, 6
# Priority: high
# Description: Create live visualization of PyMDP belief states, free energy, and policy selection.
# Details:
Build D3.js-based visualization in Next.js (active-inference-dashboard.tsx). Stream real-time data via WebSocket. Display belief distributions, free energy, and policy rankings.

# Test Strategy:
Test visualization rendering, data streaming, and accuracy of displayed metrics.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Architectural Planning and Committee Debate [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Define the overall architecture for the dashboard, integrating D3.js, dashboard components, WebSocket streaming, and visualization modules. Facilitate a structured debate among committee members to weigh modularity (Robert C. Martin), functional purity (Rich Hickey), testability (Kent Beck), scalability (Martin Fowler), and mathematical rigor (Karl Friston, Thomas Parr). Document consensus and dissenting opinions to guide implementation.
### Details:
Robert C. Martin advocates for clear separation of concerns and SOLID principles. Rich Hickey emphasizes immutable data flows and functional composition. Kent Beck stresses test-driven development and simplicity. Martin Fowler focuses on scalability and maintainability. Karl Friston and Thomas Parr require mathematical rigor in representing belief/free energy/policy metrics. The debate should resolve architectural trade-offs, such as component granularity, state management, and data pipeline design.

## 2. D3.js Integration and Visualization Engine [pending]
### Dependencies: 7.1
### Description: Implement the D3.js visualization engine, ensuring seamless integration with the dashboard framework. Incorporate committee feedback on code modularity (Robert C. Martin), functional design (Rich Hickey), and extensibility (Martin Fowler). Ensure the engine supports dynamic updates and smooth transitions for real-time data (Yann LeCun, Geoffrey Hinton).
### Details:
Robert C. Martin recommends encapsulating D3 logic in reusable modules. Rich Hickey suggests using pure functions for data transformations. Martin Fowler advises designing for future extensibility. Yann LeCun and Geoffrey Hinton highlight the need for efficient rendering and real-time responsiveness. The engine must support animated transitions and interactive features as per D3.js best practices[2][3].

## 3. Dashboard Component Creation and UI Layout [pending]
### Dependencies: 7.1, 7.2
### Description: Design and implement dashboard components, including layout, controls, and visualization containers. Ensure accessibility (Andy Clark), responsive design (Jakob Hohwy), and intuitive user experience (Anil Seth). Integrate D3.js visualizations within these components, following committee guidance on usability and maintainability.
### Details:
Andy Clark emphasizes cognitive accessibility and clear affordances. Jakob Hohwy advocates for responsive layouts that adapt to user context. Anil Seth focuses on intuitive interaction and perceptual clarity. Components should use ARIA roles, flexible layouts, and support for dynamic resizing[4].

## 4. WebSocket Data Streaming Integration [pending]
### Dependencies: 7.1, 7.2, 7.3
### Description: Implement WebSocket-based data streaming to deliver real-time updates to the dashboard. Address committee concerns on reliability (Kent Beck), concurrency (Rich Hickey), and data consistency (Martin Fowler). Ensure the pipeline supports high-frequency updates for belief, free energy, and policy metrics (Conor Heins, Alexander Tschantz).
### Details:
Kent Beck insists on robust error handling and test coverage. Rich Hickey recommends immutable event streams and functional event handlers. Martin Fowler suggests using centralized state management for consistency. Conor Heins and Alexander Tschantz require low-latency delivery for complex metrics. The integration should follow best practices for real-time data visualization with React and D3.js[5].

## 5. Belief, Free Energy, and Policy Visualization [pending]
### Dependencies: 7.1, 7.2, 7.3, 7.4
### Description: Develop specialized D3.js visualizations for belief, free energy, and policy metrics. Ensure mathematical accuracy (Karl Friston, Thomas Parr), interpretability (Anil Seth), and production-readiness (Demis Hassabis). Facilitate committee review of visualization methods and mathematical representations.
### Details:
Karl Friston and Thomas Parr require precise mathematical mapping of metrics. Anil Seth advocates for clear, interpretable visual encodings. Demis Hassabis stresses production robustness and scalability. Visualizations should support dynamic updates, tooltips, and interactive exploration, leveraging D3.js transitions and event handling[2][3].

## 6. Accuracy Testing and Production Validation [pending]
### Dependencies: 7.1, 7.2, 7.3, 7.4, 7.5
### Description: Establish comprehensive testing protocols for data accuracy, visualization correctness, and real-time update reliability. Incorporate test-driven development (Kent Beck), code review (Robert C. Martin), and statistical validation (Geoffrey Hinton, Yann LeCun). Ensure the dashboard meets production standards for robustness and maintainability.
### Details:
Kent Beck mandates automated tests for all components. Robert C. Martin requires peer code reviews and adherence to clean code standards. Geoffrey Hinton and Yann LeCun recommend statistical checks for metric accuracy and visualization fidelity. Testing should cover edge cases, performance under load, and cross-browser compatibility[4][5].
