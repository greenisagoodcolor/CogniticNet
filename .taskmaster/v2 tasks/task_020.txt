# Task ID: 20
# Title: Polish UI Animations and Error Handling
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 3, 19
# Priority: low
# Description: Enhance UI with animations, loading states, and error handling.
# Details:
Add UI animations, loading states, and comprehensive error handling in Next.js. Use shadcn/ui components and custom animations.

# Test Strategy:
Test UI responsiveness, animation smoothness, and error handling.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Animation Implementation with Expert Committee Review [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Design and implement UI animations, ensuring smooth transitions and feedback, while incorporating expert committee debate on best practices. Robert C. Martin and Kent Beck will advocate for maintainable, testable animation code, emphasizing simplicity and refactoring. Rich Hickey will push for functional, data-driven animation state management. Martin Fowler will focus on architectural patterns (e.g., MVVM or MVC) to decouple animation logic. Conor Heins and Alexander Tschantz will analyze the cognitive impact of animations, referencing predictive processing models. Yann LeCun and Geoffrey Hinton will suggest leveraging machine learning for adaptive animations. Demis Hassabis will propose reinforcement learning for user-personalized effects. Andy Clark, Jakob Hohwy, Anil Seth, Thomas Parr, and Karl Friston will debate the role of animation in user perception and active inference. The subtask will include architectural decisions (separation of concerns, extensibility), mathematical rigor (timing curves, interpolation functions), and production-ready considerations (performance, accessibility, fallback behaviors).
### Details:
Committee members will review animation prototypes, debate approaches in a structured session, and document consensus on implementation standards. Mathematical models for animation timing and user feedback will be validated. Production readiness will be ensured through performance profiling and accessibility audits.

Before moving to the next subtask, ensure all tests pass: mypy, tsc, jest, pytest, flake8, ESLint.

## 2. Loading State Management with Committee-Driven Architecture [pending]
### Dependencies: 20.1
### Description: Develop robust loading state management, ensuring clear user feedback during asynchronous operations, guided by expert committee perspectives. Robert C. Martin and Kent Beck will emphasize clean separation of loading logic and UI, advocating for testable, SOLID-compliant code. Rich Hickey will propose immutable state models and event-driven updates. Martin Fowler will recommend patterns for state management (e.g., Redux, state machines). Conor Heins and Alexander Tschantz will discuss user cognitive load and the importance of predictive cues. Yann LeCun and Geoffrey Hinton will explore predictive modeling for loading time estimation. Demis Hassabis will suggest adaptive loading indicators based on user behavior. Andy Clark, Jakob Hohwy, Anil Seth, Thomas Parr, and Karl Friston will debate the role of uncertainty and expectation in loading feedback. Architectural decisions (centralized vs. distributed state), mathematical rigor (state transition diagrams, probabilistic loading estimates), and production-ready considerations (fallbacks, skeleton screens, accessibility) will be addressed.
### Details:
Committee will review loading state prototypes, debate architectural trade-offs, and document agreed-upon patterns. Mathematical models for state transitions and user expectation management will be validated. Production readiness will be ensured through user testing and accessibility checks.

Before moving to the next subtask, ensure all tests pass: mypy, tsc, jest, pytest, flake8, ESLint.

## 3. Error Handling Integration with Expert Committee Consensus [pending]
### Dependencies: 20.2
### Description: Integrate comprehensive error handling into the UI, ensuring clear, actionable feedback for users, with expert committee debate on implementation strategies. Robert C. Martin and Kent Beck will advocate for explicit error boundaries and test-driven error handling. Rich Hickey will propose functional error propagation and recovery. Martin Fowler will focus on error handling patterns (e.g., circuit breakers, error boundaries). Conor Heins and Alexander Tschantz will analyze the cognitive impact of error messages and recovery flows. Yann LeCun and Geoffrey Hinton will suggest predictive error detection and user guidance. Demis Hassabis will propose adaptive error messaging based on user context. Andy Clark, Jakob Hohwy, Anil Seth, Thomas Parr, and Karl Friston will debate the role of error in user learning and active inference. Architectural decisions (centralized error handling, user feedback loops), mathematical rigor (error classification, recovery strategies), and production-ready considerations (logging, monitoring, accessibility) will be incorporated.
### Details:
Committee will review error handling flows, debate implementation strategies, and document consensus on best practices. Mathematical models for error classification and user recovery will be validated. Production readiness will be ensured through comprehensive testing and monitoring setup.

Before moving to the next subtask, ensure all tests pass: mypy, tsc, jest, pytest, flake8, ESLint.

## 4. Integration and End-to-End Testing [pending]
### Dependencies: 20.3
### Description: Pass integration and end-to-end tests before completing this task and moving to the next. Reference the PRD for acceptance criteria and committee review.
### Details:
All code must meet PRD requirements and be reviewed by the expert committee. Ensure all tests (mypy, tsc, jest, pytest, flake8, ESLint) pass and integration/end-to-end tests are green before closing the task.
