# Task ID: 22
# Title: Create API Documentation and Deployment Guides
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 2, 16
# Priority: low
# Description: Generate comprehensive API documentation and deployment guides.
# Details:
Use FastAPIâ€™s built-in OpenAPI/Swagger for API docs. Write deployment guides for Docker and edge deployment.

# Test Strategy:
Validate API docs accuracy and deployment guide clarity.

# Subtasks:
## 1. API Documentation Generation [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Generate comprehensive API documentation using OpenAPI specification, ensuring clarity, consistency, and completeness. Incorporate perspectives from Robert C. Martin (clean code), Rich Hickey (simplicity), Kent Beck (test-driven), Martin Fowler (domain modeling), Conor Heins (cognitive science), Alexander Tschantz (formal methods), Yann LeCun (machine learning), Geoffrey Hinton (neural networks), Demis Hassabis (AI systems), Andy Clark (predictive processing), Jakob Hohwy (perception), Anil Seth (consciousness), Thomas Parr (active inference), Karl Friston (free energy principle).
### Details:
Define API endpoints, parameters, responses, and examples. Use OpenAPI for machine-readable documentation. Debate architectural decisions (e.g., REST vs. GraphQL), mathematical rigor (e.g., formal specification), and production-ready considerations (e.g., error handling, rate limiting). Ensure documentation is accessible to entry-level users and includes code samples, error codes, authentication, and rate limiting. Automate documentation generation where possible.

Before moving to the next subtask, ensure all tests pass: mypy, tsc, jest, pytest, flake8, ESLint.

## 2. Deployment Guide Writing [pending]
### Dependencies: 22.1
### Description: Create a detailed deployment guide for the API, addressing setup, configuration, scaling, and monitoring. Integrate insights from Robert C. Martin (maintainability), Rich Hickey (immutability), Kent Beck (continuous integration), Martin Fowler (continuous delivery), Conor Heins (cognitive load), Alexander Tschantz (verification), Yann LeCun (distributed systems), Geoffrey Hinton (robustness), Demis Hassabis (scalability), Andy Clark (adaptive systems), Jakob Hohwy (system perception), Anil Seth (self-monitoring), Thomas Parr (predictive control), Karl Friston (system dynamics).
### Details:
Document step-by-step deployment instructions, environment requirements, and best practices for scaling and monitoring. Debate architectural choices (e.g., containerization, serverless), mathematical rigor (e.g., performance modeling), and production considerations (e.g., fault tolerance, logging). Include troubleshooting tips and security recommendations. Ensure the guide is clear, concise, and up-to-date.

Before moving to the next subtask, ensure all tests pass: mypy, tsc, jest, pytest, flake8, ESLint.

## 3. Documentation Validation [pending]
### Dependencies: 22.1, 22.2
### Description: Pass integration and end-to-end tests before completing this task and moving to the next. Reference the PRD for acceptance criteria and committee review.
### Details:
All code must meet PRD requirements and be reviewed by the expert committee. Ensure all tests (mypy, tsc, jest, pytest, flake8, ESLint) pass and integration/end-to-end tests are green before closing the task.
