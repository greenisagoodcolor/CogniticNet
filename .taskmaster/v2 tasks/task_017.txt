# Task ID: 17
# Title: Develop Deployment Configuration and Monitoring UI
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 3, 4, 16
# Priority: medium
# Description: Build UI for configuring and monitoring deployments.
# Details:
Create deployment configuration and monitoring UI in Next.js. Stream deployment status via WebSocket.

# Test Strategy:
Test UI input, deployment monitoring, and status streaming.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Design and Implement Configuration UI [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Develop a user interface for deployment configuration, focusing on usability, clarity, and extensibility. Incorporate expert committee debate on UI patterns, validation rigor, and maintainability.
### Details:
Robert C. Martin and Kent Beck advocate for clean, testable UI code and clear separation of concerns. Martin Fowler emphasizes the importance of refactoring and modularity. Rich Hickey suggests leveraging immutable data structures for configuration state. Conor Heins and Alexander Tschantz recommend cognitive ergonomics to minimize user error. Architectural decisions include choosing between form-driven vs. wizard-based flows, ensuring mathematical rigor in validation logic, and designing for production scalability.

Before moving to the next subtask, ensure all tests pass: mypy, tsc, jest, pytest, flake8, ESLint.

## 2. Develop Monitoring Dashboard UI [pending]
### Dependencies: 17.1
### Description: Create a monitoring dashboard that provides real-time system status, key metrics, and actionable insights. Integrate best practices for layout, cognitive load reduction, and user workflow efficiency, informed by committee perspectives.
### Details:
Yann LeCun and Geoffrey Hinton stress the importance of intuitive data visualization and minimizing cognitive load. Demis Hassabis and Andy Clark advocate for predictive displays and actionable feedback. Jakob Hohwy, Anil Seth, and Thomas Parr focus on perceptual clarity and user attention. Karl Friston recommends hierarchical information architecture. Architectural decisions include grid vs. absolute layouts, spatial grouping, and ensuring dashboards tell a coherent story. Mathematical rigor is applied in metric aggregation and anomaly detection. Production considerations include dashboard consistency, usage tracking, and maintainability.

Before moving to the next subtask, ensure all tests pass: mypy, tsc, jest, pytest, flake8, ESLint.

## 3. Implement WebSocket Status Streaming [pending]
### Dependencies: 17.2
### Description: Integrate WebSocket-based real-time status streaming into the dashboard, ensuring robust, scalable, and secure data flow. Facilitate committee debate on protocol selection, error handling, and performance optimization.
### Details:
Rich Hickey and Robert C. Martin discuss protocol purity and error resilience. Kent Beck and Martin Fowler focus on test-driven development and refactoring for streaming logic. Yann LeCun and Geoffrey Hinton emphasize low-latency, high-throughput data pipelines. Demis Hassabis and Karl Friston highlight the importance of predictive updates and minimizing lag. Architectural decisions include protocol selection (WebSocket vs. alternatives), reconnection strategies, and mathematical rigor in data synchronization. Production readiness includes load testing, security, and monitoring.

Before moving to the next subtask, ensure all tests pass: mypy, tsc, jest, pytest, flake8, ESLint.

## 4. Conduct Integration Testing with Expert Review [pending]
### Dependencies: 17.3
### Description: Pass integration and end-to-end tests before completing this task and moving to the next. Reference the PRD for acceptance criteria and committee review.
### Details:
All code must meet PRD requirements and be reviewed by the expert committee. Ensure all tests (mypy, tsc, jest, pytest, flake8, ESLint) pass and integration/end-to-end tests are green before closing the task.
