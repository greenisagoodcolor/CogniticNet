# Task ID: 18
# Title: Optimize WebSocket Performance and Reliability
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 4
# Priority: medium
# Description: Enhance WebSocket connection management and error handling.
# Details:
Implement robust WebSocket management in FastAPI and Next.js. Add reconnection, error handling, and graceful degradation.

# Test Strategy:
Test connection reliability, reconnection logic, and error handling.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Architectural Decisions for Connection Management [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Debate and define the architectural approach for efficient WebSocket connection management, including keep-alive mechanisms, connection pooling, and resource allocation. Incorporate perspectives on maintainability (Robert C. Martin), scalability (Martin Fowler), and functional simplicity (Rich Hickey). Discuss mathematical models for connection limits and resource optimization (Karl Friston, Yann LeCun). Ensure production-readiness by considering real-world traffic patterns and monitoring requirements.
### Details:
Committee members will debate the trade-offs between object-oriented and functional approaches to connection management, with Robert C. Martin emphasizing clean interfaces, Rich Hickey advocating for immutable state, and Martin Fowler focusing on scalability patterns. Karl Friston and Yann LeCun will contribute mathematical rigor for modeling connection limits and resource allocation. Production considerations include monitoring, logging, and graceful degradation strategies.

Before moving to the next subtask, ensure all tests pass: mypy, tsc, jest, pytest, flake8, ESLint.

## 2. Design and Implementation of Robust Reconnection Logic [pending]
### Dependencies: 18.1
### Description: Develop reconnection strategies that ensure minimal downtime and data loss. Discuss exponential backoff, jitter, and state synchronization. Incorporate Kent Beck’s test-driven development, Conor Heins and Alexander Tschantz’s perspectives on adaptive algorithms, and Demis Hassabis’s focus on learning from failure patterns. Analyze the mathematical complexity of reconnection intervals and their impact on system stability.
### Details:
The committee will debate the merits of deterministic vs. probabilistic reconnection strategies, with Kent Beck emphasizing testability, Conor Heins and Alexander Tschantz proposing adaptive, context-aware reconnection, and Demis Hassabis suggesting reinforcement learning for optimizing reconnection timing. Mathematical analysis will be provided by Geoffrey Hinton and Karl Friston to ensure reconnection logic is both robust and efficient.

Before moving to the next subtask, ensure all tests pass: mypy, tsc, jest, pytest, flake8, ESLint.

## 3. Comprehensive Error Handling and Recovery Mechanisms [pending]
### Dependencies: 18.1, 18.2
### Description: Establish error detection, classification, and recovery protocols for WebSocket communication. Include perspectives from Jakob Hohwy, Anil Seth, and Thomas Parr on predictive error modeling and cognitive architectures. Robert C. Martin and Kent Beck will debate best practices for exception handling and fail-safe design. Ensure mathematical rigor in error probability estimation and recovery time analysis.
### Details:
Jakob Hohwy, Anil Seth, and Thomas Parr will introduce predictive coding frameworks for anticipating and categorizing errors. Robert C. Martin and Kent Beck will discuss clean code and TDD approaches to error handling. Mathematical models for error rates and recovery times will be developed by Karl Friston and Geoffrey Hinton. Production considerations include logging, alerting, and automated rollback mechanisms.

Before moving to the next subtask, ensure all tests pass: mypy, tsc, jest, pytest, flake8, ESLint.

## 4. Performance Tuning and Optimization Strategies [pending]
### Dependencies: 18.1, 18.2, 18.3
### Description: Optimize data transfer, latency, and throughput for WebSocket communication. Debate efficient data formats (Rich Hickey), message batching (Martin Fowler), and compression algorithms (Yann LeCun). Analyze the impact of tuning parameters on system performance using mathematical modeling (Karl Friston, Geoffrey Hinton). Ensure production-readiness with real-time monitoring and adaptive tuning.
### Details:
Rich Hickey will advocate for efficient, minimal data formats and immutable data structures. Martin Fowler will discuss batching and flow control for high-throughput scenarios. Yann LeCun will provide insights on compression and encoding. Karl Friston and Geoffrey Hinton will model the effects of tuning parameters on latency and throughput. Production strategies include real-time monitoring and automated performance adjustments.

Before moving to the next subtask, ensure all tests pass: mypy, tsc, jest, pytest, flake8, ESLint.

## 5. Reliability Testing and Validation Framework [pending]
### Dependencies: 18.1, 18.2, 18.3, 18.4
### Description: Pass integration and end-to-end tests before completing this task and moving to the next. Reference the PRD for acceptance criteria and committee review.
### Details:
All code must meet PRD requirements and be reviewed by the expert committee. Ensure all tests (mypy, tsc, jest, pytest, flake8, ESLint) pass and integration/end-to-end tests are green before closing the task.
