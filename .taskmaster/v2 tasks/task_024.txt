# Task ID: 24
# Title: Validate Mathematical Accuracy and Research Reproducibility
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 6, 23
# Priority: high
# Description: Ensure PyMDP calculations match theoretical expectations and research is reproducible.
# Details:
Validate PyMDP belief state, free energy, and policy calculations. Ensure experiment export/import for reproducibility.

# Test Strategy:
Compare PyMDP outputs to theoretical values. Test experiment export/import.

# Subtasks:
## 1. PyMDP Output Comparison Validation [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Design and implement a robust framework for comparing PyMDP simulation outputs against reference implementations and expected results. Incorporate architectural modularity (Robert C. Martin), functional purity and immutability (Rich Hickey), and test-driven development (Kent Beck). Ensure the comparison logic is extensible for future model variants (Martin Fowler) and leverages domain expertise in active inference (Conor Heins, Alexander Tschantz).
### Details:
Robert C. Martin advocates for clear separation of concerns and modular code, so the output comparison should be encapsulated in dedicated modules. Rich Hickey would push for pure functions and avoidance of side effects in the comparison logic. Kent Beck recommends writing tests before implementation to ensure correctness. Martin Fowler suggests designing for future extensibility, so the framework should allow easy addition of new output types. Conor Heins and Alexander Tschantz, as PyMDP contributors, provide insight into expected output structures and edge cases.

Before moving to the next subtask, ensure all tests pass: mypy, tsc, jest, pytest, flake8, ESLint.

## 2. Theoretical Value Validation with Mathematical Rigor [pending]
### Dependencies: 24.1
### Description: Validate that PyMDP's computed values (e.g., expected free energy, posterior beliefs) match theoretical predictions. Ensure mathematical correctness (Yann LeCun, Geoffrey Hinton), rigorous derivation checks (Karl Friston, Thomas Parr), and clear documentation of all assumptions (Andy Clark, Jakob Hohwy).
### Details:
Yann LeCun and Geoffrey Hinton emphasize mathematical soundness and reproducibility in machine learning code. Karl Friston and Thomas Parr, as originators of active inference theory, should review derivations and ensure all equations are implemented faithfully. Andy Clark and Jakob Hohwy stress the importance of transparent documentation of theoretical assumptions and limitations. All validation steps should be peer-reviewed and reproducible.

Before moving to the next subtask, ensure all tests pass: mypy, tsc, jest, pytest, flake8, ESLint.

## 3. Experiment Export Functionality and Validation [pending]
### Dependencies: 24.2
### Description: Develop and validate robust export mechanisms for PyMDP experiments, ensuring data integrity, schema versioning, and compatibility with external tools. Prioritize clean API design (Robert C. Martin), serialization best practices (Rich Hickey), and production-readiness (Martin Fowler, Demis Hassabis).
### Details:
Robert C. Martin recommends clear, maintainable APIs for export functions. Rich Hickey would advocate for using immutable data structures and pure serialization logic. Martin Fowler and Demis Hassabis emphasize the need for production-ready, scalable export mechanisms that can handle large experiment datasets. Exported data should be versioned and validated against schemas to ensure long-term compatibility.

Before moving to the next subtask, ensure all tests pass: mypy, tsc, jest, pytest, flake8, ESLint.

## 4. Experiment Import Functionality and Validation [pending]
### Dependencies: 24.3
### Description: Implement and validate import routines for PyMDP experiments, ensuring robust error handling, schema validation, and seamless integration with the simulation pipeline. Incorporate defensive programming (Kent Beck), extensibility (Martin Fowler), and cognitive model compatibility (Anil Seth, Andy Clark).
### Details:
Kent Beck recommends defensive programming and comprehensive test coverage for import routines. Martin Fowler suggests designing import logic to be extensible for future schema changes. Anil Seth and Andy Clark provide perspectives on ensuring imported experiments are compatible with cognitive modeling requirements. All import operations should include schema validation and clear error reporting.

Before moving to the next subtask, ensure all tests pass: mypy, tsc, jest, pytest, flake8, ESLint.

## 5. Reproducibility Testing and Cross-Validation [pending]
### Dependencies: 24.4
### Description: Pass integration and end-to-end tests before completing this task and moving to the next. Reference the PRD for acceptance criteria and committee review.
### Details:
All code must meet PRD requirements and be reviewed by the expert committee. Ensure all tests (mypy, tsc, jest, pytest, flake8, ESLint) pass and integration/end-to-end tests are green before closing the task.
