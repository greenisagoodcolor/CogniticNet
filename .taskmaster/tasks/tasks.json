Ensure the endpoint can accept connections and send/receive messages.\n<info added on 2025-06-28T09:29:37.229Z>\nTo implement the endpoint using FastAPI's WebSocket support, you can create a WebSocket endpoint that accepts connections and sends/receives messages. Here's how you can do it:\n\n1. **Create a Connection Manager**: This class will manage active WebSocket connections. It includes methods to connect, disconnect, and broadcast messages to all connected clients.\n\n2. **Define the WebSocket Endpoint**: Use the `@app.websocket()` decorator to define a WebSocket endpoint. This endpoint will handle WebSocket connections, accept incoming connections, and manage the sending and receiving of messages.\n\nHere's a basic example of how this might look:\n\n```python\nfrom fastapi import FastAPI, WebSocket\nfrom typing import List\n\napp = FastAPI()\n\nclass ConnectionManager:\n    def __init__(self):\n        self.active_connections: List[WebSocket] = []\n\n    async def connect(self, websocket: WebSocket):\n        await websocket.accept()\n        self.active_connections.append(websocket)\n\n    def disconnect(self, websocket: WebSocket):\n        self.active_connections.remove(websocket)\n\n    async def broadcast(self, message: str):\n        for connection in self.active_connections:\n            await connection.send_text(message)\n\nmanager = ConnectionManager()\n\n@app.websocket(\"/ws\")\nasync def websocket_endpoint(websocket: WebSocket):\n    await manager.connect(websocket)\n    try:\n        while True:\n            data = await websocket.receive_text()\n            await manager.broadcast(f\"Client said: {data}\")\n    except WebSocketDisconnect:\n        manager.disconnect(websocket)\n```\n\nThis setup allows your application to establish WebSocket connections, receive messages from clients, and broadcast messages back to all connected clients.\n</info added on 2025-06-28T09:29:37.229Z>\n<info added on 2025-06-28T09:56:12.775Z>\nCOMPREHENSIVE UX/UI TESTING COMPLETED: Systematic Playwright testing has validated the presence and functionality of all required data-testid attributes and confirmed that all dashboard panels and the main knowledge graph SVG render correctly and are detectable by automation. Route migration to the root path is complete. However, several technical issues were identified: layout instability due to continuous page and SVG height changes, performance lag with load times exceeding the CEO demo requirement, and missing loading skeletons and error states. The UX/UI committee recommends disabling animations during testing, optimizing performance to meet the <500ms load requirement, implementing loading and error states, and addressing layout shift issues. The dashboard is functionally complete with robust test coverage but requires these improvements for production readiness.\n</info added on 2025-06-28T09:56:12.775Z>",
