# Task ID: 15
# Title: Design Readiness Dashboard
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 3, 4, 14
# Priority: medium
# Description: Create UI for displaying multi-dimensional readiness metrics.
# Details:
Build readiness dashboard in Next.js. Display technical, business, and safety scores. Stream real-time updates via WebSocket.

# Test Strategy:
Test dashboard rendering, data streaming, and score accuracy.

# Subtasks:
## 1. UI Component Creation with Expert Committee Review [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Design and implement modular UI components for the dashboard, ensuring adherence to best practices in layout, accessibility, and usability. Facilitate a debate among Robert C. Martin (emphasizing clean code and SOLID principles), Kent Beck (advocating for test-driven development and simplicity), and Martin Fowler (focusing on refactoring and maintainability). Incorporate feedback from Conor Heins and Alexander Tschantz on cognitive ergonomics and user perception, ensuring the UI supports intuitive navigation and clear data hierarchy.
### Details:
Architect the UI using a component-based framework (e.g., React or Vue). Prioritize card layouts and F-pattern scanning as recommended in dashboard UX research[5]. Ensure each component is independently testable and reusable. Discuss trade-offs between rapid prototyping and long-term maintainability, referencing Martin Fowler's refactoring patterns and Robert C. Martin's emphasis on code clarity. Integrate accessibility checks and user-centric design principles, drawing on insights from cognitive science committee members.

Before moving to the next subtask, ensure all tests pass: mypy, tsc, jest, pytest, flake8, ESLint.

## 2. Score Visualization Design and Mathematical Rigor [pending]
### Dependencies: 15.1
### Description: Develop robust score visualization modules (e.g., charts, gauges, heatmaps) that accurately represent readiness metrics. Lead a committee debate involving Yann LeCun, Geoffrey Hinton, and Demis Hassabis on the mathematical underpinnings of score aggregation and visualization. Include Andy Clark, Jakob Hohwy, and Anil Seth to ensure visualizations align with human perceptual strengths and minimize cognitive load.
### Details:
Select visualization types based on data characteristics and user needs, referencing best practices for clarity and interpretability[2][5]. Ensure mathematical rigor in score calculation and representation, with LeCun and Hinton debating normalization, aggregation, and statistical accuracy. Hassabis to advocate for explainability and actionable insights. Cognitive scientists to review color schemes, legend placement, and interaction patterns for perceptual clarity. Document all architectural decisions and rationale.

Before moving to the next subtask, ensure all tests pass: mypy, tsc, jest, pytest, flake8, ESLint.

## 3. WebSocket Data Streaming Architecture and Production Readiness [pending]
### Dependencies: 15.1
### Description: Architect and implement real-time data streaming using WebSockets, ensuring scalability, reliability, and low latency. Facilitate a debate between Rich Hickey (favoring simplicity and immutability), Robert C. Martin (emphasizing robust interfaces), and Martin Fowler (advocating for clear separation of concerns and deployment flexibility). Karl Friston and Thomas Parr to review the architecture for robustness in dynamic, uncertain environments.
### Details:
Design a WebSocket layer that decouples data ingestion from UI rendering. Discuss trade-offs between event-driven and polling architectures, referencing Hickey's preference for simple, composable systems. Martin Fowler to review for maintainability and deployment strategies. Friston and Parr to assess the system's ability to handle noisy or incomplete data streams, ensuring resilience and graceful degradation. Include production-ready considerations such as monitoring, error handling, and security.

Before moving to the next subtask, ensure all tests pass: mypy, tsc, jest, pytest, flake8, ESLint.

## 4. Accuracy Testing, Validation, and Continuous Improvement [pending]
### Dependencies: 15.2, 15.3
### Description: Establish a comprehensive testing and validation framework for the dashboard, covering UI correctness, score calculation accuracy, and data streaming reliability. Lead a debate among Kent Beck (test-driven development), Anil Seth (perceptual validation), and Geoffrey Hinton (statistical robustness). Include Martin Fowler for continuous integration and deployment best practices.
### Details:
Develop automated test suites for UI components, score calculations, and WebSocket data flows. Kent Beck to champion TDD and rapid feedback cycles. Anil Seth to propose perceptual validation tests (e.g., user studies, A/B testing) to ensure insights are accurately conveyed. Hinton to review statistical validation of metrics and streaming data. Fowler to ensure tests are integrated into CI/CD pipelines for ongoing quality assurance. Document all test cases and validation criteria.

Before moving to the next subtask, ensure all tests pass: mypy, tsc, jest, pytest, flake8, ESLint.

## 5. Integration and End-to-End Testing [pending]
### Dependencies: 15.4
### Description: Pass integration and end-to-end tests before completing this task and moving to the next. Reference the PRD for acceptance criteria and committee review.
### Details:
All code must meet PRD requirements and be reviewed by the expert committee. Ensure all tests (mypy, tsc, jest, pytest, flake8, ESLint) pass and integration/end-to-end tests are green before closing the task.
