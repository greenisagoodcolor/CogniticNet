# Task ID: 16
# Title: Implement Automated Deployment Pipeline
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 2, 12, 14
# Priority: medium
# Description: Build pipeline for Docker containerization and edge deployment.
# Details:
Implement export builder (infrastructure/export/export_builder.py). Package coalitions, optimize for hardware, and generate Docker containers. Use Docker SDK for Python.

# Test Strategy:
Test container generation, hardware optimization, and deployment readiness.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Export Builder Implementation [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Develop an export builder that integrates with the CI/CD pipeline, incorporating feedback from Robert C. Martin on clean code principles and Rich Hickey on immutability.
### Details:
This task involves designing the export builder to ensure it is modular, maintainable, and follows best practices for software development. Robert C. Martin's emphasis on clean code will guide the implementation, while Rich Hickey's perspective on immutability will ensure data integrity.

Before moving to the next subtask, ensure all tests pass: mypy, tsc, jest, pytest, flake8, ESLint.

## 2. Hardware Optimization [pending]
### Dependencies: 16.1
### Description: Optimize hardware configurations for efficient deployment, considering insights from Martin Fowler on architectural patterns and Kent Beck on test-driven development.
### Details:
This task focuses on optimizing hardware resources to support the deployment pipeline efficiently. Martin Fowler's expertise in architectural patterns will help in designing scalable systems, while Kent Beck's approach to test-driven development will ensure that optimizations are validated through rigorous testing.

Before moving to the next subtask, ensure all tests pass: mypy, tsc, jest, pytest, flake8, ESLint.

## 3. Docker Container Generation [pending]
### Dependencies: 16.2
### Description: Create Docker containers for the application, leveraging Conor Heins' knowledge on containerization best practices and Alexander Tschantz's insights on cloud-native applications.
### Details:
This task involves generating Docker containers that are lightweight, secure, and optimized for deployment. Conor Heins' expertise in containerization will ensure that containers are properly configured, while Alexander Tschantz's understanding of cloud-native applications will guide the design for scalability and reliability.

Before moving to the next subtask, ensure all tests pass: mypy, tsc, jest, pytest, flake8, ESLint.

## 4. Deployment Readiness Checks [pending]
### Dependencies: 16.3
### Description: Implement automated checks to ensure deployment readiness, drawing from Yann LeCun and Geoffrey Hinton's perspectives on AI-driven monitoring and Demis Hassabis' insights on system reliability.
### Details:
This task involves setting up automated checks to verify that the application is ready for deployment. Yann LeCun and Geoffrey Hinton's expertise in AI can be applied to create intelligent monitoring systems, while Demis Hassabis' focus on system reliability will ensure that checks are comprehensive and robust.

Before moving to the next subtask, ensure all tests pass: mypy, tsc, jest, pytest, flake8, ESLint.

## 5. Testing and Validation [pending]
### Dependencies: 16.4
### Description: Pass integration and end-to-end tests before completing this task and moving to the next. Reference the PRD for acceptance criteria and committee review.
### Details:
All code must meet PRD requirements and be reviewed by the expert committee. Ensure all tests (mypy, tsc, jest, pytest, flake8, ESLint) pass and integration/end-to-end tests are green before closing the task.
