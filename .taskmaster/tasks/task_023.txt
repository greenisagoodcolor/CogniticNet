# Task ID: 23
# Title: Implement End-to-End Testing and Demo Rehearsal
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 7, 11, 13, 15, 17, 19, 20, 21
# Priority: high
# Description: Conduct end-to-end testing and demo rehearsal.
# Details:
Script and automate end-to-end tests. Rehearse demo flow with all features integrated.

# Test Strategy:
Run end-to-end tests, validate demo flow, and fix issues.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Test Script Creation with Expert Committee Review [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Develop comprehensive end-to-end test scripts covering all critical user flows, incorporating architectural decisions and mathematical rigor. Facilitate a structured debate among committee members: Robert C. Martin and Kent Beck advocate for clear, maintainable test cases; Martin Fowler emphasizes test coverage and pyramid strategy; Rich Hickey and Conor Heins discuss functional purity and cognitive modeling in test design; Yann LeCun and Geoffrey Hinton stress data-driven scenarios and learning-based validation; Demis Hassabis, Andy Clark, Jakob Hohwy, Anil Seth, Thomas Parr, and Karl Friston contribute perspectives on system-level cognition, predictive processing, and uncertainty quantification.
### Details:
Scripts must be peer-reviewed by the committee, with explicit documentation of debated trade-offs (e.g., maintainability vs. coverage, functional vs. behavioral focus).

Before moving to the next subtask, ensure all tests pass: mypy, tsc, jest, pytest, flake8, ESLint.

## 2. Automation Setup and Framework Selection [pending]
### Dependencies: 23.1
### Description: Establish the automation environment and select appropriate tools/frameworks for executing end-to-end tests. Committee members debate: Robert C. Martin and Kent Beck prioritize simplicity and refactorability; Martin Fowler and Rich Hickey discuss integration with CI/CD and functional test harnesses; Yann LeCun and Geoffrey Hinton evaluate AI-driven test automation; Demis Hassabis and Karl Friston assess the use of probabilistic models for test orchestration.
### Details:
Document architectural decisions, toolchain justifications, and committee consensus or dissent on automation strategies.

Before moving to the next subtask, ensure all tests pass: mypy, tsc, jest, pytest, flake8, ESLint.

## 3. Demo Flow Rehearsal and Scenario Validation [pending]
### Dependencies: 23.2
### Description: Rehearse key demo flows using the automated scripts, ensuring all business-critical scenarios are covered. Committee members (Kent Beck, Martin Fowler, Conor Heins, Andy Clark, Anil Seth) debate the realism and completeness of demo scenarios, balancing user-centric design with system-level validation.
### Details:
Capture feedback on scenario gaps, edge cases, and user experience fidelity. Adjust scripts and flows based on committee recommendations.

Before moving to the next subtask, ensure all tests pass: mypy, tsc, jest, pytest, flake8, ESLint.

## 4. Issue Tracking and Prioritization with Committee Arbitration [pending]
### Dependencies: 23.3
### Description: Implement a robust issue tracking system for defects and test failures. Committee members (Robert C. Martin, Rich Hickey, Jakob Hohwy, Thomas Parr) debate prioritization criteria: code quality, cognitive impact, and risk. Establish a transparent arbitration process for resolving disputes on issue severity and fix urgency.
### Details:
Document all committee decisions and rationales for issue triage, ensuring traceability and production-readiness.

Before moving to the next subtask, ensure all tests pass: mypy, tsc, jest, pytest, flake8, ESLint.

## 5. Integration Testing and Cross-System Validation [pending]
### Dependencies: 23.4
### Description: Conduct integration testing across all subsystems, validating data flow and interface contracts. Committee members (Martin Fowler, Conor Heins, Yann LeCun, Geoffrey Hinton, Demis Hassabis, Karl Friston) debate the depth of integration coverage, mathematical rigor in interface validation, and the use of AI/ML for anomaly detection.
### Details:
Ensure all integration points are tested under realistic loads and failure conditions. Document architectural and mathematical considerations debated by the committee.

Before moving to the next subtask, ensure all tests pass: mypy, tsc, jest, pytest, flake8, ESLint.

## 6. Bug Fixing, Regression Testing, and Production-Ready Sign-off [pending]
### Dependencies: 23.5
### Description: Pass integration and end-to-end tests before completing this task and moving to the next. Reference the PRD for acceptance criteria and committee review.
### Details:
All code must meet PRD requirements and be reviewed by the expert committee. Ensure all tests (mypy, tsc, jest, pytest, flake8, ESLint) pass and integration/end-to-end tests are green before closing the task.
