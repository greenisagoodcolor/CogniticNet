# Task ID: 11
# Title: Design Dual-Layer Knowledge Graph Visualization
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 3, 4, 10
# Priority: medium
# Description: Create visualization for collective and individual knowledge layers.
# Details:
Build D3.js-based dual-layer knowledge graph in Next.js (dual-layer-knowledge-graph.tsx). Stream real-time updates via WebSocket.

# Test Strategy:
Test visualization rendering, data streaming, and layer synchronization.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Architect Dual-Layer D3.js Visualization Structure [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Define the architectural blueprint for a dual-layer D3.js graph, including data flow, separation of concerns, and extensibility for real-time updates. Incorporate committee debate on modularity (Robert C. Martin), functional purity (Rich Hickey), and testability (Kent Beck).
### Details:
Robert C. Martin advocates for clear separation of concerns and modular design, ensuring each graph layer is independently maintainable. Rich Hickey emphasizes immutable data structures and pure functions for predictable rendering. Kent Beck stresses the importance of test-driven development and refactorability. The committee should debate the trade-offs between a monolithic vs. micro-component architecture, considering future scalability and maintainability.

## 2. Design and Implement UI Components for Layered Graph Interaction [pending]
### Dependencies: 11.1
### Description: Develop reusable UI components for interacting with the dual-layer graph, such as selectors, tooltips, and legends. Discuss component granularity (Martin Fowler), cognitive ergonomics (Andy Clark, Jakob Hohwy), and user feedback mechanisms (Kent Beck).
### Details:
Martin Fowler recommends a component-based UI with clear boundaries and minimal coupling. Andy Clark and Jakob Hohwy highlight the need for intuitive interfaces that align with users' perceptual models. Kent Beck suggests iterative prototyping with user feedback loops. The committee should debate the optimal balance between component reusability and domain specificity, ensuring accessibility and responsiveness.

## 3. Integrate WebSocket Data Streaming for Real-Time Updates [pending]
### Dependencies: 11.1
### Description: Establish a robust WebSocket pipeline for streaming data to the visualization, ensuring low latency and fault tolerance. Discuss concurrency models (Rich Hickey), probabilistic data handling (Karl Friston, Thomas Parr), and production reliability (Geoffrey Hinton, Yann LeCun).
### Details:
Rich Hickey advocates for asynchronous, event-driven data flows to avoid blocking UI updates. Karl Friston and Thomas Parr suggest incorporating uncertainty quantification in streaming data, possibly using Bayesian updates. Geoffrey Hinton and Yann LeCun emphasize the need for scalable, production-grade infrastructure with monitoring and fallback strategies. The committee should debate the trade-offs between push vs. pull models and the mathematical rigor of data synchronization.

## 4. Implement Layer Synchronization and Mathematical Consistency [pending]
### Dependencies: 11.3
### Description: Develop synchronization logic to ensure both graph layers update coherently in response to streamed data. Address mathematical rigor (Anil Seth, Alexander Tschantz, Conor Heins), state management (Demis Hassabis), and error handling (Martin Fowler).
### Details:
Anil Seth, Alexander Tschantz, and Conor Heins advocate for mathematically principled synchronization, possibly leveraging predictive coding or information theory. Demis Hassabis recommends centralized state management to avoid race conditions and ensure consistency. Martin Fowler stresses robust error handling and recovery strategies. The committee should debate the merits of optimistic vs. pessimistic synchronization and the use of formal verification for critical update paths.

## 5. Develop and Execute Rendering and Synchronization Test Suite [pending]
### Dependencies: 11.2, 11.4
### Description: Create comprehensive tests for rendering correctness, real-time updates, and synchronization integrity. Discuss test coverage (Kent Beck), adversarial scenarios (Yann LeCun, Geoffrey Hinton), and continuous integration (Robert C. Martin).
### Details:
Kent Beck insists on high test coverage, including unit, integration, and end-to-end tests. Yann LeCun and Geoffrey Hinton propose adversarial testing to uncover edge cases in real-time data handling. Robert C. Martin recommends integrating tests into a CI/CD pipeline for production readiness. The committee should debate the balance between automated and manual testing, and the use of property-based or fuzz testing for robustness.
