# Task ID: 13
# Title: Build Coalition Visualization and Dashboard
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 3, 4, 12
# Priority: medium
# Description: Create UI for visualizing coalitions and business metrics.
# Details:
Build coalition visualization and business metrics dashboard in Next.js. Stream real-time coalition events via WebSocket.

# Test Strategy:
Test visualization rendering, event streaming, and metric accuracy.

# Subtasks:
## 1. UI Component Development with Expert Committee Review [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Design and implement modular, reusable UI components for the dashboard, ensuring clarity, accessibility, and responsiveness. Facilitate an expert committee debate on component architecture, with Robert C. Martin advocating for SOLID principles and clean code, Kent Beck emphasizing test-driven development, and Martin Fowler focusing on refactoring and maintainability. Rich Hickey will contribute perspectives on simplicity and immutability in UI state management. The committee will debate the merits of declarative vs. imperative UI frameworks, component granularity, and strategies for minimizing technical debt.
### Details:
Architectural decisions will include component hierarchy, state management (e.g., Redux vs. local state), and integration with real-time data streams. Mathematical rigor will be applied in layout algorithms and performance profiling. Production-ready considerations include accessibility (WCAG compliance), cross-browser compatibility, and automated UI testing.

## 2. Real-Time Event Streaming Pipeline with Committee Oversight [pending]
### Dependencies: 13.1
### Description: Design and implement a robust real-time event streaming pipeline to capture, process, and deliver live data to the dashboard. The committee will include Conor Heins and Alexander Tschantz (data modeling and pipeline efficiency), Yann LeCun and Geoffrey Hinton (scalability and machine learning integration), and Demis Hassabis (AI-driven anomaly detection). The debate will cover event sourcing vs. pub/sub architectures, use of tools like Apache Kafka, and strategies for ensuring low-latency, high-throughput data delivery.
### Details:
Architectural decisions will address schema evolution, fault tolerance, and exactly-once delivery semantics. Mathematical rigor will be applied in throughput analysis, latency modeling, and probabilistic data validation. Production-ready considerations include monitoring, alerting, and automated failover.

## 3. Business Metric Visualization and Analytical Rigor [pending]
### Dependencies: 13.2
### Description: Develop and integrate advanced visualizations for key business metrics, ensuring actionable insights and predictive analytics. The committee will feature Andy Clark, Jakob Hohwy, Anil Seth (cognitive science perspectives on perception and usability), Thomas Parr, and Karl Friston (statistical modeling and Bayesian inference). The debate will focus on optimal chart types (e.g., line, bar, heatmap), predictive vs. descriptive analytics, and the cognitive load of complex visualizations.
### Details:
Architectural decisions will include selection of visualization libraries, data aggregation strategies, and support for drill-down/interactive features. Mathematical rigor will be applied in statistical aggregation, trend analysis, and uncertainty quantification. Production-ready considerations include performance optimization for large datasets and responsive design for multiple devices.

## 4. Integration Testing and Production Readiness Review [pending]
### Dependencies: 13.3
### Description: Conduct comprehensive integration testing across UI components, real-time streaming, and metric visualizations. The expert committee (all members) will debate test coverage strategies, continuous integration pipelines, and criteria for production readiness. Robert C. Martin and Kent Beck will focus on automated testing and code quality, while Demis Hassabis and Yann LeCun will review AI/ML integration robustness.
### Details:
Architectural decisions will include test orchestration (unit, integration, end-to-end), mocking of real-time data streams, and rollback strategies. Mathematical rigor will be applied in test coverage analysis and reliability modeling. Production-ready considerations include deployment automation, monitoring, and incident response protocols.
