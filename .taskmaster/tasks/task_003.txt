# Task ID: 3
# Title: Build Next.js Frontend Foundation
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1
# Priority: high
# Description: Set up Next.js 14+ with TypeScript, React hooks, and Context API for state management.
# Details:
Initialize Next.js project with TypeScript. Configure React hooks and Context API for global state. Set up basic routing and layout components. Use shadcn/ui for UI components.

# Test Strategy:
Verify project setup, routing, and basic UI rendering.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Project Initialization and Folder Structure [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Set up a new Next.js project with a production-ready folder structure, considering maintainability, scalability, and best practices.
### Details:
Robert C. Martin advocates for a clean, modular folder structure to maximize maintainability and separation of concerns. Martin Fowler emphasizes the importance of clear boundaries between domains and features, suggesting a feature-based or domain-driven structure. Rich Hickey would argue for simplicity and minimalism, avoiding unnecessary abstractions. The committee should debate the merits of colocating components, hooks, and styles versus separating by type, referencing Next.js 15 best practices for SEO and development speed[1].

Before moving to the next subtask, ensure all tests pass: mypy, tsc, jest, pytest, flake8, ESLint.

## 2. TypeScript Configuration and Strictness [pending]
### Dependencies: 3.1
### Description: Integrate TypeScript into the Next.js project, configuring strict type checking and aligning with mathematical rigor and production standards.
### Details:
Kent Beck supports test-driven development and type safety for robust code. Conor Heins and Alexander Tschantz, with backgrounds in computational neuroscience, would advocate for mathematical rigor in type definitions and interfaces. Geoffrey Hinton and Yann LeCun would stress the importance of type safety for reproducibility and reliability in production systems. The committee should debate the trade-offs between strictness (e.g., strictNullChecks, noImplicitAny) and developer velocity, ensuring the configuration supports both rapid prototyping and long-term maintainability.

Before moving to the next subtask, ensure all tests pass: mypy, tsc, jest, pytest, flake8, ESLint.

## 3. React Hooks Setup and Best Practices [pending]
### Dependencies: 3.2
### Description: Establish a standardized approach for creating and organizing custom React hooks, ensuring composability, testability, and clarity.
### Details:
Andy Clark and Jakob Hohwy, with expertise in cognitive science, would emphasize composability and modularity, drawing parallels to cognitive architectures. Kent Beck would advocate for hooks that are easy to test and refactor. Rich Hickey would caution against over-abstraction and encourage hooks that solve real, composable problems. The committee should discuss naming conventions, colocating hooks with features, and strategies for sharing logic across the app, referencing Next.js and React best practices[4].

Before moving to the next subtask, ensure all tests pass: mypy, tsc, jest, pytest, flake8, ESLint.

## 4. Context API Integration and State Management Architecture [pending]
### Dependencies: 3.3
### Description: Design and implement a scalable Context API solution for global state, considering alternatives and mathematical models for state propagation.
### Details:
Karl Friston and Thomas Parr, known for their work on predictive coding and hierarchical models, would suggest a layered approach to state management, minimizing unnecessary re-renders and optimizing data flow. Demis Hassabis and Anil Seth would advocate for architectures that support both local and global state, ensuring cognitive scalability. Martin Fowler would recommend evaluating when to use Context versus more robust solutions (Redux, Zustand) for production readiness. The committee should debate context splitting, memoization, and the mathematical implications of state propagation and update frequency.

Before moving to the next subtask, ensure all tests pass: mypy, tsc, jest, pytest, flake8, ESLint.

## 5. Basic Routing and Layout Implementation [pending]
### Dependencies: 3.4
### Description: Implement Next.js routing and layout patterns, ensuring accessibility, SEO, and maintainability, with a focus on mathematical rigor in navigation logic.
### Details:
Robert C. Martin and Martin Fowler would stress the importance of clear, predictable routing and layout hierarchies. Yann LeCun and Geoffrey Hinton would highlight the need for efficient, scalable navigation logic, possibly referencing graph theory for route relationships. The committee should debate the use of the App Router, dynamic routes, and layout composition, referencing Next.js 2025 best practices for performance and SEO[1][3]. Production considerations include lazy loading, code splitting, and accessibility compliance.

Before moving to the next subtask, ensure all tests pass: mypy, tsc, jest, pytest, flake8, ESLint.

## 6. Integration and End-to-End Testing [pending]
### Dependencies: 3.5
### Description: Pass integration and end-to-end tests before completing this task and moving to the next. Reference the PRD for acceptance criteria and committee review.
### Details:
All code must meet PRD requirements and be reviewed by the expert committee. Ensure all tests (mypy, tsc, jest, pytest, flake8, ESLint) pass and integration/end-to-end tests are green before closing the task.
