# Task ID: 25
# Title: Prepare for Industry Recognition and Publication
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 22, 23, 24
# Priority: medium
# Description: Prepare platform for industry recognition, research publication, and real-world deployment.
# Details:
Collect success metrics (mathematical accuracy, user engagement, research adoption). Prepare documentation for publications and deployments.

# Test Strategy:
Validate success metrics, documentation, and readiness for publication.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Success Metric Collection and Validation [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Design and implement a robust process for collecting, validating, and analyzing success metrics, ensuring mathematical rigor and production-readiness. Facilitate an expert committee debate on metric selection, data integrity, and statistical methods, referencing perspectives such as Geoffrey Hinton's emphasis on statistical learning, Yann LeCun's focus on scalable architectures, and Karl Friston's insistence on model evidence and Bayesian approaches.
### Details:
Committee members will discuss: (a) metric definitions (e.g., accuracy, F1, ROC-AUC), (b) data partitioning strategies (Kent Beck and Martin Fowler on test-driven and agile data validation), (c) architectural implications for metric instrumentation (Robert C. Martin on clean code and modularity), and (d) mathematical soundness (Karl Friston, Thomas Parr). Production-readiness will be debated by Demis Hassabis and Conor Heins, focusing on real-world deployment constraints.

Before moving to the next subtask, ensure all tests pass: mypy, tsc, jest, pytest, flake8, ESLint.

## 2. Comprehensive Documentation Preparation [pending]
### Dependencies: 25.1
### Description: Develop detailed technical and user documentation, incorporating architectural diagrams, mathematical formulations, and implementation notes. Organize a committee debate on documentation standards, clarity, and completeness, referencing Robert C. Martin's advocacy for self-documenting code, Martin Fowler's patterns for documentation, and Anil Seth's perspective on communicating complex concepts to diverse audiences.
### Details:
The committee will review: (a) documentation structure (Martin Fowler, Robert C. Martin), (b) inclusion of mathematical derivations and proofs (Karl Friston, Thomas Parr, Alexander Tschantz), (c) clarity for both technical and non-technical stakeholders (Anil Seth, Jakob Hohwy), and (d) integration with codebases (Kent Beck, Rich Hickey on literate programming and code-as-documentation).

Before moving to the next subtask, ensure all tests pass: mypy, tsc, jest, pytest, flake8, ESLint.

## 3. Publication Drafting and Peer Review Preparation [pending]
### Dependencies: 25.2
### Description: Draft the publication manuscript, ensuring adherence to best practices in transparency, reproducibility, and ethical AI use. Facilitate an expert committee debate on narrative structure, mathematical rigor, and ethical considerations, referencing Yann LeCun's and Geoffrey Hinton's standards for scientific communication, and Andy Clark's emphasis on theoretical framing.
### Details:
Committee members will debate: (a) manuscript structure and clarity (Andy Clark, Anil Seth), (b) inclusion of reproducible experiments and code (Rich Hickey, Kent Beck), (c) ethical and transparent reporting (Demis Hassabis, Yann LeCun), and (d) mathematical and theoretical soundness (Geoffrey Hinton, Karl Friston, Thomas Parr).

Before moving to the next subtask, ensure all tests pass: mypy, tsc, jest, pytest, flake8, ESLint.

## 4. Deployment Readiness Review and Final Approval [pending]
### Dependencies: 25.3
### Description: Conduct a comprehensive review of deployment readiness, including code quality, scalability, and monitoring strategies. Organize a final committee debate on architectural decisions, production constraints, and risk mitigation, referencing Robert C. Martin's clean architecture, Conor Heins' and Alexander Tschantz's views on system robustness, and Demis Hassabis' focus on real-world impact.
### Details:
The committee will assess: (a) codebase modularity and maintainability (Robert C. Martin, Martin Fowler), (b) system scalability and monitoring (Yann LeCun, Conor Heins), (c) risk assessment and mitigation strategies (Demis Hassabis, Karl Friston), and (d) alignment with industry best practices and ethical guidelines (Anil Seth, Andy Clark).

Before task completion, pass integration and end-to-end tests. Reference the PRD for acceptance criteria and committee review. Ensure all tests (mypy, tsc, jest, pytest, flake8, ESLint) pass and integration/end-to-end tests are green before closing the task.
