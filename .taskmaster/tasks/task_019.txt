# Task ID: 19
# Title: Implement Performance Monitoring and Optimization
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 3, 4, 18
# Priority: medium
# Description: Add performance monitoring and optimization for frontend and backend.
# Details:
Integrate performance monitoring hooks (usePerformanceMonitor.ts). Optimize rendering, memory usage, and WebSocket streaming.

# Test Strategy:
Test performance metrics, rendering speed, and memory usage.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Monitoring Hook Integration with Expert Committee Review [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Design and implement monitoring hooks across the application stack, ensuring hooks are placed at critical points for data collection. Facilitate a debate among Robert C. Martin (emphasizing clean code and separation of concerns), Kent Beck (advocating for testability and simplicity), and Martin Fowler (focusing on architectural patterns and maintainability) to determine optimal integration strategies. Incorporate perspectives from Yann LeCun and Geoffrey Hinton on the mathematical rigor of data collection, ensuring hooks do not introduce significant overhead or bias.
### Details:
Architectural decisions should address where hooks are injected (middleware, controllers, services), how data is captured (sync vs async), and how to minimize performance impact. Mathematical rigor involves ensuring sampling does not skew metrics. Production-ready considerations include robust error handling and minimal invasiveness.

Before moving to the next subtask, ensure all tests pass: mypy, tsc, jest, pytest, flake8, ESLint.

## 2. Frontend Performance Optimization with Committee Consensus [pending]
### Dependencies: 19.1
### Description: Analyze and optimize frontend performance metrics such as load time, interactivity, and rendering efficiency. Engage Rich Hickey (favoring simplicity and immutability), Conor Heins, and Alexander Tschantz (emphasizing cognitive load and user experience) in a structured debate on trade-offs between code complexity, user experience, and monitoring granularity. Include Andy Clark and Jakob Hohwy for perspectives on perceptual bottlenecks and predictive processing.
### Details:
Architectural decisions include which metrics to monitor (e.g., Time to Interactive, First Contentful Paint), how to instrument them, and how to visualize results. Mathematical rigor involves statistical analysis of user interaction data. Production-ready considerations include browser compatibility and minimal impact on user experience.

Before moving to the next subtask, ensure all tests pass: mypy, tsc, jest, pytest, flake8, ESLint.

## 3. Backend Performance Optimization with Expert Deliberation [pending]
### Dependencies: 19.1
### Description: Optimize backend performance by monitoring request latency, throughput, resource utilization, and error rates. Facilitate a debate among Robert C. Martin (clean architecture), Martin Fowler (microservices and scalability), and Karl Friston (predictive coding and system efficiency) to determine the best approaches for scalable, maintainable monitoring. Include Anil Seth and Thomas Parr for insights on system observability and error propagation.
### Details:
Architectural decisions involve selecting appropriate monitoring tools (APM, custom metrics), defining alert thresholds, and ensuring observability across distributed systems. Mathematical rigor includes analyzing request distributions and resource usage patterns. Production-ready considerations cover failover, redundancy, and minimal performance overhead.

Before moving to the next subtask, ensure all tests pass: mypy, tsc, jest, pytest, flake8, ESLint.

## 4. WebSocket Streaming Optimization with Committee Input [pending]
### Dependencies: 19.1, 19.3
### Description: Monitor and optimize WebSocket streaming performance, focusing on message latency, throughput, and connection stability. Organize a debate with Kent Beck (test-driven development for real-time systems), Demis Hassabis (AI-driven optimization), and Geoffrey Hinton (efficient data encoding and transmission) to evaluate monitoring strategies. Include perspectives from Andy Clark and Jakob Hohwy on real-time feedback and cognitive responsiveness.
### Details:
Architectural decisions include where to instrument WebSocket events, how to aggregate and analyze streaming metrics, and how to handle high-frequency data. Mathematical rigor involves time-series analysis and anomaly detection. Production-ready considerations include handling network variability and ensuring data integrity.

Before moving to the next subtask, ensure all tests pass: mypy, tsc, jest, pytest, flake8, ESLint.

## 5. Metrics Testing and Validation with Cross-Disciplinary Review [pending]
### Dependencies: 19.2, 19.3, 19.4
### Description: Pass integration and end-to-end tests before completing this task and moving to the next. Reference the PRD for acceptance criteria and committee review.
### Details:
All code must meet PRD requirements and be reviewed by the expert committee. Ensure all tests (mypy, tsc, jest, pytest, flake8, ESLint) pass and integration/end-to-end tests are green before closing the task.
