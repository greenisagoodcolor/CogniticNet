# Task ID: 5
# Title: Develop Goal Processing Pipeline
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 2, 3
# Priority: high
# Description: Implement LLM-based goal interpretation and agent initialization.
# Details:
Integrate LLM provider interface (e.g., OpenAI, Anthropic) for goal interpretation. Build goal input UI in Next.js. Connect LLM output to agent factory and PyMDP initialization. Use structured context matrices.

# Test Strategy:
Test end-to-end goal â†’ agent creation flow, validate context matrix generation.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Architect LLM Provider Integration [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Design and implement the integration layer for LLM providers, ensuring modularity, scalability, and flexibility to support multiple vendors and deployment environments.
### Details:
Robert C. Martin advocates for clean, modular interfaces and separation of concerns. Rich Hickey emphasizes simplicity and immutability in integration logic. Martin Fowler recommends using pipeline workflow patterns for scalability and maintainability[1][3]. Yann LeCun and Geoffrey Hinton stress the importance of efficient model inference and robust API contracts. Architectural decisions should include fallback strategies, rate limiting, and observability for production readiness.

## 2. Develop Goal Input UI [pending]
### Dependencies: 5.1
### Description: Create a user interface for goal input that is intuitive, accessible, and supports structured and unstructured goal definitions.
### Details:
Kent Beck and Martin Fowler prioritize test-driven development and user-centric design. Jakob Hohwy and Anil Seth highlight the need for clear affordances to minimize cognitive load. Andy Clark suggests leveraging predictive feedback to guide user input. UI should be modular to allow rapid iteration and A/B testing, with accessibility and internationalization as production-ready considerations.

## 3. Implement Backend Goal Interpretation Logic [pending]
### Dependencies: 5.2
### Description: Translate user-submitted goals into actionable representations, leveraging LLMs for semantic parsing and validation.
### Details:
Conor Heins and Alexander Tschantz emphasize mathematical rigor in goal formalization. Karl Friston and Thomas Parr recommend using active inference principles for goal representation. Rich Hickey and Robert C. Martin stress clear separation between parsing, validation, and transformation stages. Production considerations include error handling, logging, and extensibility for new goal types.

## 4. Connect to Agent Factory [pending]
### Dependencies: 5.3
### Description: Establish a robust interface between the backend and the agent factory, enabling dynamic instantiation and configuration of agents based on interpreted goals.
### Details:
Martin Fowler and Robert C. Martin advocate for dependency inversion and interface-driven design. Demis Hassabis and Andy Clark suggest supporting agent composability and adaptability. The interface should support versioning, monitoring, and rollback for production safety.

## 5. Initialize PyMDP for Agent Planning [pending]
### Dependencies: 5.4
### Description: Integrate PyMDP to initialize agent planning modules, ensuring correct parameterization and alignment with interpreted goals.
### Details:
Conor Heins and Alexander Tschantz require mathematical rigor in MDP setup. Karl Friston and Thomas Parr recommend embedding active inference mechanisms. Geoffrey Hinton and Yann LeCun stress computational efficiency and reproducibility. Production readiness includes resource management, error propagation, and logging.

## 6. Generate Context Matrix for Agent Execution [pending]
### Dependencies: 5.5
### Description: Produce a context matrix that encodes relevant environmental and historical information for agent decision-making.
### Details:
Andy Clark, Jakob Hohwy, and Anil Seth emphasize predictive processing and context sensitivity. Demis Hassabis and Geoffrey Hinton recommend leveraging learned representations for richer context. Rich Hickey and Kent Beck stress testability and immutability. The matrix should be versioned and auditable for production use.

## 7. Conduct End-to-End Flow Testing and Validation [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Design and execute comprehensive tests covering the entire pipeline, including unit, integration, and mock testing to ensure robustness and reliability.
### Details:
Kent Beck and Martin Fowler advocate for automated test suites and continuous integration. Robert C. Martin stresses code coverage and maintainability. Yann LeCun and Demis Hassabis recommend scenario-based and adversarial testing. Production readiness requires monitoring, alerting, and rollback strategies.
