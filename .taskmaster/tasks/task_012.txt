# Task ID: 12
# Title: Implement Coalition Formation Algorithms
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 2, 6
# Priority: medium
# Description: Develop algorithms for detecting synergistic capabilities and forming coalitions.
# Details:
Build coalition formation engine (coalitions/formation/coalition_formation_algorithms.py). Detect synergies, optimize business value, and assess readiness.

# Test Strategy:
Test coalition detection, value optimization, and readiness assessment.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Synergy Detection and Coalition Candidate Generation [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Identify potential synergies among agents by analyzing their capabilities, goals, and possible interactions. Generate candidate coalitions based on detected synergies, ensuring mathematical rigor in the evaluation of agent complementarities. Facilitate an expert committee debate on the architectural approach: Robert C. Martin and Kent Beck advocate for modular, testable code; Rich Hickey emphasizes simplicity and immutability in data structures; Yann LeCun and Geoffrey Hinton stress the importance of scalable, data-driven synergy detection using neural representations.
### Details:
Architectural decisions should balance modularity (Martin, Beck), functional purity (Hickey), and computational efficiency (LeCun, Hinton). Mathematical models for synergy should be validated for correctness and scalability.

Before moving to the next subtask, ensure all tests pass: mypy, tsc, jest, pytest, flake8, ESLint.

## 2. Coalitional Value Optimization [pending]
### Dependencies: 12.1
### Description: Develop and formalize algorithms to compute and optimize the value of each candidate coalition. This includes distributed calculation of coalitional values, expected outcomes, and cost-benefit analysis. Committee debate: Martin Fowler and Conor Heins discuss domain-driven design and interpretability; Alexander Tschantz and Karl Friston emphasize Bayesian and free-energy principles for value estimation; Demis Hassabis and Andy Clark focus on cognitive architectures for adaptive optimization.
### Details:
Ensure mathematical rigor in value computation (Friston, Tschantz), maintain code clarity and maintainability (Fowler), and support adaptive, learning-based optimization (Hassabis, Clark).

Before moving to the next subtask, ensure all tests pass: mypy, tsc, jest, pytest, flake8, ESLint.

## 3. Readiness Assessment and Coalition Feasibility [pending]
### Dependencies: 12.2
### Description: Assess the readiness of each coalition candidate for task execution, considering agent availability, resource constraints, and environmental factors. Committee debate: Jakob Hohwy and Anil Seth discuss predictive processing and uncertainty quantification; Thomas Parr and Karl Friston advocate for formal readiness metrics based on active inference; Robert C. Martin and Kent Beck stress the importance of clear readiness criteria and automated checks.
### Details:
Architectural decisions should support automated readiness checks (Martin, Beck), probabilistic assessment (Hohwy, Seth), and formal mathematical metrics (Parr, Friston).

Before moving to the next subtask, ensure all tests pass: mypy, tsc, jest, pytest, flake8, ESLint.

## 4. Algorithm Implementation and Mathematical Validation [pending]
### Dependencies: 12.3
### Description: Implement coalition formation, value optimization, and readiness assessment algorithms with production-ready code. Ensure mathematical correctness through formal proofs and empirical validation. Committee debate: Rich Hickey and Kent Beck focus on test-driven development and immutability; Geoffrey Hinton and Yann LeCun emphasize scalable, parallelizable algorithms; Martin Fowler advocates for refactoring and maintainability.
### Details:
Implementation should be modular (Fowler), testable (Beck), and mathematically validated (Hinton, LeCun). Code reviews and formal verification are required.

Before moving to the next subtask, ensure all tests pass: mypy, tsc, jest, pytest, flake8, ESLint.

## 5. System Integration and Architectural Review [pending]
### Dependencies: 12.4
### Description: Integrate coalition formation components into the broader system architecture, ensuring interoperability and scalability. Conduct an expert committee review: Robert C. Martin and Martin Fowler lead architectural evaluation; Demis Hassabis and Andy Clark assess cognitive integration; Alexander Tschantz and Karl Friston review for theoretical soundness.
### Details:
Integration must adhere to clean architecture principles (Martin, Fowler), support cognitive and adaptive features (Hassabis, Clark), and maintain theoretical rigor (Tschantz, Friston).

Before moving to the next subtask, ensure all tests pass: mypy, tsc, jest, pytest, flake8, ESLint.

## 6. Testing, Validation, and Complexity Analysis [pending]
### Dependencies: 12.5
### Description: Pass integration and end-to-end tests before completing this task and moving to the next. Reference the PRD for acceptance criteria and committee review.
### Details:
All code must meet PRD requirements and be reviewed by the expert committee. Ensure all tests (mypy, tsc, jest, pytest, flake8, ESLint) pass and integration/end-to-end tests are green before closing the task.
