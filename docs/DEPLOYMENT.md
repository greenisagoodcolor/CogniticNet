   - Show resource distribution and environmental factors
   
   **Key Features**:
   - "Agents navigate using Active Inference principles"
   - "Spatial decisions minimize expected free energy"
   - "Real-world geography integration possible"

### üìä Part 6: Knowledge & Experiments (3-5 min)

9. **Knowledge Graph** (`http://localhost:3000/knowledge`)
   - Show how agents build shared knowledge
   - Demonstrate knowledge evolution over time
   - Highlight distributed intelligence aspects

10. **Experiments** (`http://localhost:3000/experiments`)
    - Show experiment setup and monitoring
    - Demonstrate data collection capabilities
    - Highlight research applications

## Key Talking Points Throughout Demo

### Technical Differentiators:
1. **Mathematical Rigor**: "Unlike chatbots, our agents use formal Active Inference theory"
2. **Real Implementation**: "Not a wrapper - actual implementation of peer-reviewed algorithms"
3. **Production Ready**: "Enterprise-grade UI with comprehensive error handling"
4. **Scalable**: "Designed for thousands of agents with efficient state management"

### Business Value:
1. **Research Platform**: "Used for cognitive science and AI research"
2. **Simulation**: "Test complex scenarios before real-world deployment"
3. **Emergent Intelligence**: "Behaviors emerge from principles, not programming"
4. **Extensible**: "Easy to add new agent types and environments"

## Common Questions & Answers

**Q: How is this different from LLM agents?**
A: "LLMs generate text; our agents minimize free energy through mathematical principles. They have beliefs, uncertainty, and make decisions based on expected outcomes."

**Q: What's Active Inference?**
A: "A unified theory of brain function. Agents act to minimize surprise and uncertainty about their environment."

**Q: Can it scale?**
A: "Yes, the architecture supports distributed computation and efficient state management."

**Q: Real-world applications?**
A: "Robotics, autonomous systems, financial modeling, social simulations, and cognitive science research."

## Troubleshooting

### If TypeScript errors appear:
- The 3 compilation errors have been fixed
- If new ones appear, focus on the working features

### If Python backend isn't running:
- The frontend can still demonstrate UI and mathematical concepts
- Mention "backend API being optimized for performance"

### Performance issues:
- Reduce number of active agents
- Use Chrome for best D3.js performance
- Close other browser tabs

## Post-Demo

1. Share the GitHub repository (prepare link)
2. Offer to send technical documentation
3. Suggest specific use cases for their industry
4. Schedule follow-up for deeper technical dive

## Quick Commands Reference
```bash
# Start development server
npm run dev

# Build for production (if needed)
npm run build
npm start

# Run type checking (avoid during demo)
# npm run type-check

# Format code (if making live changes)
npm run format
```

Remember: Focus on the mathematical rigor, real-time visualizations, and emergent behaviors. These are your unique selling points!
