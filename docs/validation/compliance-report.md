# Documentation Compliance Report

This report summarizes the results of validating the project documentation against ADR-002 (Canonical Directory Structure), ADR-003 (Dependency Rules), and ADR-004 (Naming Conventions).

## Executive Summary

The validation identified **7 categories of issues** that need to be addressed to ensure full compliance with the architectural decisions:

1. Documentation files outside the `docs/` directory
2. API documentation files outside the `docs/api/` directory
3. Core Domain importing from Interface or Infrastructure layers in code examples
4. Documentation files not following kebab-case naming convention
5. Use of prohibited terms (gaming terminology) in documentation
6. Python classes not using PascalCase in code examples
7. TypeScript components not using PascalCase in code examples

## Detailed Findings

### ADR-002: Canonical Directory Structure Validation

#### Issue 1: Documentation Files Outside of docs/ Directory

- **Severity**: High
- **Finding**: 392 documentation files were found outside the `docs/` directory.
- **Impact**: Violates the canonical directory structure, making documentation harder to find and maintain.
- **Recommendation**:
  - Most of these files are in `node_modules/` and are part of dependencies, which can be ignored.
  - The README.md files in the root directory and in component directories should be moved to the appropriate locations in the `docs/` directory.
  - Create symbolic links from the original locations to the new locations if necessary.

#### Issue 2: API Documentation Files Outside of docs/api/ Directory

- **Severity**: Medium
- **Finding**: 2 API documentation files were found outside the `docs/api/` directory:
  - `./docs/active-inference/api-reference.md`
  - `./docs/architecture/decisions/008-api-interface-layer-architecture.md`
- **Impact**: Makes API documentation harder to find and maintain.
- **Recommendation**:
  - Move `./docs/active-inference/api-reference.md` to `./docs/api/active-inference-api.md`
  - Keep the ADR file in its current location as it's an architectural decision record, not API documentation.

### ADR-003: Dependency Rules Validation

#### Issue 3: Core Domain Importing from Interface or Infrastructure Layers

- **Severity**: High
- **Finding**: Multiple examples in documentation show Core Domain components importing from Interface or Infrastructure layers.
- **Impact**: Promotes incorrect architectural patterns that violate the dependency rules.
- **Recommendation**:
  - Update all code examples to follow the dependency rules.
  - Clearly mark examples that show incorrect patterns as anti-patterns.
  - Add explanations about why these patterns violate the dependency rules.

### ADR-004: Naming Conventions Validation

#### Issue 4: Documentation Files Not Following Kebab-Case Convention

- **Severity**: Medium
- **Finding**: 59 documentation files do not follow the kebab-case naming convention.
- **Impact**: Inconsistent naming makes the documentation harder to navigate and maintain.
- **Recommendation**:
  - Rename all documentation files to follow kebab-case convention.
  - Update all references to these files in other documentation.
  - Consider using a script to automate this process.

#### Issue 5: Use of Prohibited Terms

- **Severity**: Medium
- **Finding**: Several prohibited terms (gaming terminology) were found in the documentation:
  - `PlayerAgent`: 7 instances
  - `NPCAgent`: 7 instances
  - `spawn(`: 5 instances
  - `GameWorld`: 5 instances
- **Impact**: Use of gaming terminology is unprofessional for enterprise software.
- **Recommendation**:
  - Replace all instances of prohibited terms with their approved alternatives.
  - Most instances appear to be in the context of explaining the naming conventions themselves, which is acceptable.
  - Update any actual code examples or explanations that use these terms.

#### Issue 6: Python Classes Not Using PascalCase

- **Severity**: Medium
- **Finding**: 12 instances of Python classes not using PascalCase were found in code examples.
- **Impact**: Inconsistent naming in code examples can lead to confusion and poor coding practices.
- **Recommendation**:
  - Update all Python class definitions in code examples to use PascalCase.
  - Ensure that abstract classes and data classes also follow this convention.

#### Issue 7: TypeScript Components Not Using PascalCase

- **Severity**: Low
- **Finding**: 2 instances of TypeScript components not using PascalCase were found in code examples.
- **Impact**: Inconsistent naming in code examples can lead to confusion and poor coding practices.
- **Recommendation**:
  - Update all TypeScript component definitions in code examples to use PascalCase.
  - Ensure that React components and similar UI components follow this convention.

## Remediation Plan

### Immediate Actions (High Priority)

1. **Fix Core Domain Import Examples**:
   - Review all code examples in documentation that show Core Domain components importing from Interface or Infrastructure layers.
   - Update these examples to follow the dependency rules or clearly mark them as anti-patterns.

2. **Move Critical Documentation**:
   - Move the API reference from `./docs/active-inference/api-reference.md` to `./docs/api/active-inference-api.md`.
   - Create symbolic links if necessary to maintain backward compatibility.

### Short-Term Actions (Medium Priority)

1. **Rename Documentation Files**:
   - Create a script to rename all documentation files to follow kebab-case convention.
   - Update all references to these files in other documentation.

2. **Replace Prohibited Terms**:
   - Review all instances of prohibited terms and replace them with approved alternatives where appropriate.
   - Keep instances that are used in the context of explaining naming conventions.

3. **Fix Code Examples**:
   - Update all Python class definitions in code examples to use PascalCase.
   - Update all TypeScript component definitions in code examples to use PascalCase.

### Long-Term Actions (Low Priority)

1. **Documentation Structure Cleanup**:
   - Review and reorganize the documentation structure to fully comply with ADR-002.
   - Consider creating a documentation style guide to ensure future compliance.

2. **Automated Validation**:
   - Integrate the documentation validation script into the CI/CD pipeline.
   - Create pre-commit hooks to validate documentation changes before they are committed.

## Conclusion

While the documentation has several compliance issues, most are relatively straightforward to fix. The most critical issues are related to dependency rule violations in code examples, which should be addressed immediately to prevent the propagation of incorrect architectural patterns.

By following the remediation plan outlined above, the project can achieve full compliance with the architectural decisions related to documentation structure, dependency rules, and naming conventions.

## Next Steps

1. Present this report to the team for review and prioritization.
2. Assign specific team members to address each category of issues.
3. Set up regular validation checks to ensure ongoing compliance.
4. Update the documentation validation script as needed to catch additional issues.
