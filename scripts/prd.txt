# CogniticNet Security & Quality Improvement Project

## Project Overview

**Project Name:** CogniticNet Security & Quality Improvement
**Version:** 1.0
**Date:** January 2025

### Executive Summary

This project addresses critical security vulnerabilities, code quality issues, and technical debt identified through comprehensive QA/QC analysis of the CogniticNet application. The primary focus is on fixing security flaws related to API key handling and encryption, while systematically improving code quality, build processes, and maintainability.

CogniticNet is a sophisticated multi-agent UI design and interaction simulation platform built with Next.js 15, React, TypeScript, and modern UI components. While the application demonstrates strong architectural understanding and complex functionality, several critical security and quality issues require immediate attention.

## Problem Statement

### Critical Security Issues
1. **API Key Security Breach**: The current API key storage mechanism uses sessionStorage in server-side API routes, which is fundamentally broken and insecure
2. **Hardcoded Encryption Key**: The encryption key is hardcoded in client-side code, making all encryption trivial to break
3. **Build Configuration Issues**: TypeScript and ESLint errors are ignored during builds, hiding potential runtime issues

### Quality & Maintainability Issues
1. **Unstable Dependencies**: Multiple dependencies are pinned to "latest" causing potential breaking changes
2. **Code Duplication**: Duplicate hooks and components across the codebase
3. **Complex State Management**: Overly complex client-side settings initialization
4. **Inconsistent Error Handling**: Various error handling patterns throughout the application

## Project Goals

### Primary Goals (Security)
- Implement secure server-side API key storage and management
- Establish proper encryption key management using environment variables
- Fix build configuration to catch errors during development

### Secondary Goals (Quality)
- Stabilize dependency management with proper version pinning
- Refactor duplicate code and simplify complex state management
- Improve error handling consistency and user experience
- Enhance code maintainability and developer experience

### Success Metrics
- All security vulnerabilities resolved with zero client-side API key exposure
- Build process catches 100% of TypeScript and ESLint errors
- Code duplication reduced by 80%
- Development workflow improved with consistent error handling

## Technical Requirements
